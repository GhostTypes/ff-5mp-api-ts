Unicode includes characters which are made by multiple code points.
RegExp character class syntax (`/[abc]/`) cannot handle characters which are made by multiple code points as a character; those characters will be dissolved to each code point. For example, `❇️` is made by `❇` (`U+2747`) and VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (`U+FE0F`). If this character is in a RegExp character class, it will match either `❇` (`U+2747`) or VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (`U+FE0F`) rather than `❇️`.

This rule reports regular expressions which include multiple code point characters in character class syntax. This rule considers the following characters as multiple code point characters.

**A character with combining characters:**

The combining characters are characters which belong to one of `Mc`, `Me`, and `Mn` [Unicode general categories](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L1999/UnicodeData.html#General%20Category).

```js
/^[Á]$/u.test("Á"); //→ false
/^[❇️]$/u.test("❇️"); //→ false
```

**A character with Emoji modifiers:**

```js
/^[👶🏻]$/u.test("👶🏻"); //→ false
/^[👶🏽]$/u.test("👶🏽"); //→ false
```

**A pair of regional indicator symbols:**

```js
/^[🇯🇵]$/u.test("🇯🇵"); //→ false
```

**Characters that ZWJ joins:**

```js
/^[👨‍👩‍👦]$/u.test("👨‍👩‍👦"); //→ false
```

**A surrogate pair without Unicode flag:**

```js
/^[👍]$/.test("👍"); //→ false

// Surrogate pair is OK if with u flag.
/^[👍]$/u.test("👍"); //→ true
```

## Rule Details

This rule reports regular expressions which include multiple code point characters in character class syntax.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

**Incorrect Example**

> ```js
> /*eslint no-misleading-character-class: error */
>
> /^[Á]$/u;
> /^[❇️]$/u;
> /^[👶🏻]$/u;
> /^[🇯🇵]$/u;
> /^[👨‍👩‍👦]$/u;
> /^[👍]$/;
> new RegExp("[🎵]");
> ```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

**Correct Example**

> ```js
> /*eslint no-misleading-character-class: error */
>
> /^[abc]$/;
> /^[👍]$/u;
> /^[\q{👶🏻}]$/v;
> new RegExp("^[]$");
> new RegExp(`[Á-${z}]`, "u"); // variable pattern
> ```

## Options

This rule has an object option:

* `"allowEscape"`: When set to `true`, the rule allows any grouping of code points inside a character class as long as they are written using escape sequences. This option only has effect on regular expression literals and on regular expressions created with the `RegExp` constructor with a literal argument as a pattern.

### allowEscape

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule with the `{ "allowEscape": true }` option:

**Incorrect Example**

> ```js
> /* eslint no-misleading-character-class: ["error", { "allowEscape": true }] */
>
> /[\👍]/; // backslash can be omitted
>
> new RegExp("[\ud83d" + "\udc4d]");
>
> const pattern = "[\ud83d\udc4d]";
> new RegExp(pattern);
> ```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule with the `{ "allowEscape": true }` option:

**Correct Example**

> ```js
> /* eslint no-misleading-character-class: ["error", { "allowEscape": true }] */
>
> /[\ud83d\udc4d]/;
> /[\u00B7\u0300-\u036F]/u;
> /[👨\u200d👩]/u;
> new RegExp("[\x41\u0301]");
> new RegExp(`[\u{1F1EF}\u{1F1F5}]`, "u");
> new RegExp("[\\u{1F1EF}\\u{1F1F5}]", "u");
> ```

## When Not To Use It

You can turn this rule off if you don't want to check RegExp character class syntax for multiple code point characters.
