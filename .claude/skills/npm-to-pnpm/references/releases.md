## Patch Changes

* Fixed installation of config dependencies from private registries.

  Added support for object type in `configDependencies` when the tarball URL returned from package metadata differs from the computed URL [#10431](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10431).
* Fix path traversal vulnerability in binary fetcher ZIP extraction

  + Validate ZIP entry paths before extraction to prevent writing files outside target directory
  + Validate BinaryResolution.prefix (basename) to prevent directory escape via crafted prefix
  + Both attack vectors now throw `ERR_PNPM_PATH_TRAVERSAL` error
* Support plain `http://` and `https://` URLs ending with `.git` as git repository dependencies.

  Previously, URLs like `https://gitea.example.org/user/repo.git#commit` were not recognized as git repositories because they lacked the `git+` prefix (e.g., `git+https://`). This caused issues when installing dependencies from self-hosted git servers like Gitea or Forgejo that don't provide tarball downloads.

  Changes:

  + The git resolver now runs before the tarball resolver, ensuring git URLs are handled by the correct resolver
  + The git resolver now recognizes plain `http://` and `https://` URLs ending in `.git` as git repositories
  + Removed the `isRepository` check from the tarball resolver since it's no longer needed with the new resolver order

  Fixes [#10468](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10468)
* `pnpm run -r` and `pnpm run --filter` now fail with a non-zero exit code when no packages have the specified script. Previously, this only failed when all packages were selected. Use `--if-present` to suppress this error [#6844](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/6844).
* Fixed a path traversal vulnerability in tarball extraction on Windows. The path normalization was only checking for `./` but not `.\`. Since backslashes are directory separators on Windows, malicious packages could use paths like `foo\..\..\.npmrc` to write files outside the package directory.
* When running "pnpm exec" from a subdirectory of a project, don't change the current working directory to the root of the project [#5759](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/5759).
* Fixed a path traversal vulnerability in pnpm's bin linking. Bin names starting with `@` bypassed validation, and after scope normalization, path traversal sequences like `../../` remained intact.
* Revert Try to avoid making network calls with preferOffline [#10334](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10334).
* Fix `--save-peer` to write valid semver ranges to `peerDependencies` for protocol-based installs (e.g. `jsr:`) by deriving from resolved versions when available and falling back to `*` if none is available [#10417](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10417).
* Do not exclude the root workspace project, when it is explicitly selected via a filter [#10465](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10465).

Pre-release

## Major Changes

* `pnpm config get` (without `--json`) no longer print INI formatted text.  
  Instead, it would print JSON for both objects and arrays and raw string for  
  strings, numbers, booleans, and nulls.  
  `pnpm config get --json` would still print all types of values as JSON like before.
* Replace workspace project specific `.npmrc` with `packageConfigs` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

  A workspace manifest with `packageConfigs` would look something like this:

  ```
  # File: pnpm-workspace.yaml
  packages:
    - "packages/project-1"
    - "packages/project-2"
  packageConfigs:
    "project-1":
      saveExact: true
    "project-2":
      savePrefix: "~"
  ```

  Or this:

  ```
  # File: pnpm-workspace.yaml
  packages:
    - "packages/project-1"
    - "packages/project-2"
  packageConfigs:
    - match: ["project-1", "project-2"]
      modulesDir: "node_modules"
      saveExact: true
  ```
* `strictDepBuilds` is `true` by default.
* `pnpm config list` and `pnpm config get` (without argument) now hide auth-related settings.
* `blockExoticSubdeps` is `true` by default.
* This package is now pure ESM.
* pnpm no longer loads non-auth and non-registry settings from rc files. Other settings must be defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
* The pnpm CLI now gets installed with a specific version of Node.js, which it uses for its runtime. This makes pnpm more stable and it doesn't rely on your globally install Node.js anymore.
* Node.js v18 and 19 support discontinued.
* `pnpm config get <array>` now prints a JSON array.
* The default value of the `type` field in the `package.json` file of the project initialized by `pnpm init` command has been changed to `module`.
* `pnpm config list` and `pnpm config get` (without argument) now show top-level keys as camelCase.  
  Exception: Keys that start with `@` or `//` would be preserved (their cases don't change).
* `pnpm config list` now prints a JSON object instead of INI formatted text.
* `pnpm config get` and `pnpm config list` no longer load non camelCase options from the workspace manifest (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
* Runtime dependencies are always linked from the global virtual store [#10233](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10233).
* Removed support for the `useNodeVersion` and `executionEnv.nodeVersion` fields. `devEngines.runtime` and `engines.runtime` should be used instead [#10373](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10373).
* Support lowercase options in `pnpm add`: `-d`, `-p`, `-o`, `-e` [#9197](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9197).

  When using `pnpm add` command only:

  + `-p` is now an alias for `--save-prod` instead of `--parseable`
  + `-d` is now an alias for `--save-dev` instead of `--loglevel=info`
* Remove deprecated build dependency settings: `onlyBuiltDependencies`, `onlyBuiltDependenciesFile`, `neverBuiltDependencies`, and `ignoredBuiltDependencies`.

  Use the `allowBuilds` setting instead. It is a map where keys are package name patterns and values are booleans:

  + `true` means the package is allowed to run build scripts
  + `false` means the package is explicitly denied from running build scripts

  Same as before, by default, none of the packages in the dependencies are allowed to run scripts. If a package has postinstall scripts and it isn't declared in `allowBuilds`, an error is printed.

  Before:

  ```
  onlyBuiltDependencies:
    - electron
  onlyBuiltDependenciesFile: "allowed-builds.json"
  neverBuiltDependencies:
    - core-js
  ignoredBuiltDependencies:
    - esbuild
  ```

  After:

  ```
  allowBuilds:
    electron: true
    core-js: false
    esbuild: false
  ```

## Minor Changes

* Load environment variables whose names start with `pnpm_config_` into config. These environment variables override settings from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` but not the CLI arguments.
* Add support for a global YAML config file named `config.yaml`.

  Now configurations are divided into 2 categories:

  + Registry and auth settings which can be stored in INI files such as global `rc` and local `.npmrc`.
  + pnpm-specific settings which can only be loaded from YAML files such as global `config.yaml` and local `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
* Added support for pnpmfiles written in ESM. They should have the `.mjs` extension: `.pnpmfile.mjs` [#9730](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9730).
* When pnpm updates the `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, comments, string formatting, and whitespace will be preserved.

[pnpm 10.28](/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.28.0)

## Minor Changes

* Add support for a hook called `beforePacking` that can be used to customize the `package.json` contents at publish time [#3816](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3816).
* In some cases, a filtered install (i.e. `pnpm install --filter ...`) was slower than running `pnpm install` without any filter arguments. This performance regression is now fixed. Filtered installs should be as fast or faster than a full install [#10408](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10408).

## Patch Changes

* Do not add a symlink to the project into the store's project registry if the store is in a subdirectory of the project [#10411](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10411).
* It should be possible to declare the `requiredScripts` setting in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` [#10261](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10261).

* Adding `trustPolicyIgnoreAfter` allows you to ignore trust policy checks for packages published more than a specified time ago[#10352](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10352).
* Added project registry for global virtual store prune support.

  Projects using the store are now registered via symlinks in `{storeDir}/v10/projects/`. This enables `pnpm store prune` to track which packages are still in use by active projects and safely remove unused packages from the global virtual store.
* **Semi-breaking.** Changed the location of unscoped packages in the virtual global store. They will now be stored under a directory named `@` to maintain a uniform 4-level directory depth.
* Added mark-and-sweep garbage collection for global virtual store.

  `pnpm store prune` now removes unused packages from the global virtual store's `links/` directory. The algorithm:

  1. Scans all registered projects for symlinks pointing to the store
  2. Walks transitive dependencies to mark reachable packages
  3. Removes any package directories not marked as reachable

  This includes support for workspace monorepos - all `node_modules` directories within a project (including those in workspace packages) are scanned.

## Patch Changes

* Throw an error if the value of the `tokenHelper` or `<url>:tokenHelper` setting contains an environment variable.
* Git dependencies with build scripts should respect the `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds` settings [#10376](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10376).
* Skip the package manager check when running with --global and a project packageManager is configured, and warn that the check is skipped.
* `pnpm store prune` should not fail if the dlx cache directory has files, not only directories [#10384](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10384)
* Fixed a bug ([#9759](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9759)) where `pnpm add` would incorrectly modify a catalog entry in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to its exact version.

[pnpm 10.26.2](/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.26.2)

## Patch Changes

* Improve error message when a package version exists but does not meet the `minimumReleaseAge` constraint. The error now clearly states that the version exists and shows a human-readable time since release (e.g., "released 6 hours ago") [#10307](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10307).
* Fix installation of Git dependencies using annotated tags [#10335](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10335).

  Previously, pnpm would store the annotated tag object's SHA in the lockfile instead of the actual commit SHA. This caused `ERR_PNPM_GIT_CHECKOUT_FAILED` errors because the checked-out commit hash didn't match the stored tag object hash.
* Binaries of runtime engines (Node.js, Deno, Bun) are written to `node_modules/.bin` before lifecycle scripts (install, postinstall, prepare) are executed [#10244](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10244).
* Try to avoid making network calls with preferOffline [#10334](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10334).

## Major Changes

* `pnpm config get` (without `--json`) no longer print INI formatted text.  
  Instead, it would print JSON for both objects and arrays and raw string for  
  strings, numbers, booleans, and nulls.  
  `pnpm config get --json` would still print all types of values as JSON like before.
* `pnpm config list` and `pnpm config get` (without argument) now hide auth-related settings.
* This package is now pure ESM.
* pnpm no longer loads non-auth and non-registry settings from rc files. Other settings must be defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
* The pnpm CLI now gets installed with a specific version of Node.js, which it uses for its runtime. This makes pnpm more stable and it doesn't rely on your globally install Node.js anymore.
* Node.js v18 and 19 support discontinued.
* `pnpm config get <array>` now prints a JSON array.
* The default value of the `type` field in the `package.json` file of the project initialized by `pnpm init` command has been changed to `module`.
* `pnpm config list` and `pnpm config get` (without argument) now show top-level keys as camelCase.  
  Exception: Keys that start with `@` or `//` would be preserved (their cases don't change).
* The standalone exe version of pnpm requires at least glibc 2.27.
* `pnpm config list` now prints a JSON object instead of INI formatted text.
* `pnpm config get` and `pnpm config list` no longer load non camelCase options from the workspace manifest (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
* JSON files in the store and cache are replaced with binary files generated with v8.serialize.

  Reading and deserializing a binary file generated with v8.serialize appears to be about 23% faster than reading and parsing a JSON file. Other operations are similar in speed. Therefore, we have switched to V8 binary files for storing data in pnpm’s global store and cache. The disadvantage of this approach is that V8 files generated by newer versions of Node.js cannot be deserialized by older versions. In such cases, we ignore the cache.

  Related PR: [#9971](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9971).
* Runtime dependencies are always linked from the global virtual store [#10233](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10233).
* Support lowercase options in `pnpm add`: `-d`, `-p`, `-o`, `-e` [#9197](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9197).

  When using `pnpm add` command only:

  + `-p` is now an alias for `--save-prod` instead of `--parseable`
  + `-d` is now an alias for `--save-dev` instead of `--loglevel=info`

## Minor Changes

* Load environment variables whose names start with `pnpm_config_` into config. These environment variables override settings from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` but not the CLI arguments.
* Add support for a global YAML config file named `config.yaml`.

  Now configurations are divided into 2 categories:

  + Registry and auth settings which can be stored in INI files such as global `rc` and local `.npmrc`.
  + pnpm-specific settings which can only be loaded from YAML files such as global `config.yaml` and local `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
* Added support for pnpmfiles written in ESM. They should have the `.mjs` extension: `.pnpmfile.mjs` [#9730](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9730).

### Patch Changes

* Explicitly tell `npm` the path to the global `rc` config file.

[pnpm 10.26](/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.26.0)

## Minor Changes

* **Semi-breaking.** Block git-hosted dependencies from running prepare scripts unless explicitly allowed in `onlyBuiltDependencies` [#10288](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10288).
* **Semi-breaking.** Compute integrity hash for HTTP tarball dependencies when fetching, storing it in the lockfile to prevent servers from serving altered content on subsequent installs [#10287](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10287).
* Added a new setting `blockExoticSubdeps` that prevents the resolution of exotic protocols in transitive dependencies.

  When set to `true`, direct dependencies (those listed in your root `package.json`) may still use exotic sources, but all transitive dependencies must be resolved from a trusted source. Trusted sources include the configured registry, local file paths, workspace links, trusted GitHub repositories (node, bun, deno), and custom resolvers.

  This helps to secure the dependency supply chain. Packages from trusted sources are considered safer, as they are typically subject to more reliable verification and scanning for malware and vulnerabilities.

  **Exotic sources** are dependency locations that bypass the usual trusted resolution process. These protocols are specifically targeted and blocked: Git repositories (`git+ssh://...`) and direct URL links to tarballs (`https://.../package.tgz`).

  Related PR: [#10265](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10265).
* Added support for `allowBuilds`, which is a new field that can be used instead of `onlyBuiltDependencies` and `ignoredBuiltDependencies`. The new `allowBuilds` field in your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` uses a map of package matchers to explicitly allow (`true`) or disallow (`false`) script execution. This allows for a single, easy-to-manage source of truth for your build permissions.

  **Example Usage.** To explicitly allow all versions of `esbuild` to run scripts and prevent `core-js` from running them:

  ```
  allowBuilds:
    esbuild: true
    core-js: false
  ```

  The example above achieves the same result as the previous configuration:

  ```
  onlyBuiltDependencies:
    - esbuild
  ignoredBuiltDependencies:
    - core-js
  ```

  Related PR: [#10311](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10311)
* Added support for `--dry-run` to the `pack` command [#10301](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10301).

## Patch Changes

* Show deprecation in table/list formats when latest version is deprecated [#8658](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8658).
* Remove the `injectWorkspacePackages` setting from the lockfile on the `deploy` command [#10294](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10294).
* Normalize the tarball URLs before saving them to the lockfile. URLs should not contain default ports, like :80 for http and :443 for https [#10273](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10273).
* When a dependency is installed via a direct URL that redirects to another URL and is immutable, the original URL is normalized and saved to `package.json` [#10197](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10197).

[pnpm 10.25](/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.25.0)

## Minor Changes

* Allow loading certificates from `cert`, `ca`, and `key` for specific registry URLs. E.g., `//registry.example.com/:ca=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...`. Previously this was only working via `certfile`, `cafile`, and `keyfile`.

  These properties are supported in `.npmrc`, but were ignored by pnpm, this will make pnpm read and use them as well.

  Related PR: [#10230](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10230).
* Added a new flag called `--bare` to `pnpm init` for creating a package.json with the bare minimum of required fields [#10226](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10226).

## Patch Changes

* Improved reporting of ignored dependency scripts [#10276](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10276).
* `pnpm install` should build any dependencies that were added to `onlyBuiltDependencies` and were not built yet [#10256](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10256).
* `pnpm publish -r --force` should allow to run publish over already existing versions in the registry [#10272](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10272).
* Don't fail with a `ERR_PNPM_MISSING_TIME` error if a package that is excluded from trust policy checks is missing the time field in the metadata.

[pnpm 10.24](/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.24.0)

## Minor Changes

* Increased network concurrency on machines with many CPU cores. pnpm now automatically selects a network concurrency between 16 and 64, based on the number of pnpm workers (calculated as workers × 3). This improves performance on high-core systems [#10068](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10068).

## Patch Changes

* `trustPolicy` should ignore the trust evidences of prerelease versions, when installing a non-prerelease version.
* Handle ENOENT errors thrown by `fs.linkSync()`, which can occur in containerized environments (OverlayFS) instead of EXDEV. The operation now gracefully falls back to `fs.copyFileSync()` in these cases [#10217](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10217).
* Reverted: `pnpm self-update` should download pnpm from the configured npm registry [#10205](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10205).
* Packages that don't have a `package.json` file (like Node.js) should not be reimported from the store on every install. Another file from the package should be checked in order to verify its presence in `node_modules`.
* Correctly read auth tokens for URLs that contain underscores [#17](https://github.com/pnpm/npm-conf/pull/17).
